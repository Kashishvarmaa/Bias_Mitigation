CO 2 and CO 3 equipped me with the skills to apply measures of central tendencies, variability, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis, and frequency table analysis, enabling me to identify patterns and trends within datasets. CO 4 expanded my knowledge to include data visualization techniques such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps, empowering me to detect outliers and explore correlations effectively. CO 5 emphasized the importance of data preprocessing, including handling missing values, duplicate values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to enhance data quality. The course delved into the art of effective data storytelling (CO 6), ensuring that I can communicate insights and recommendations for data-driven decision-making. CO 7 provided practical experience in data interpretation using visualizations created by India in Pixels. Moreover, the course broadened my perspective in CO 8 by highlighting the application of machine learning in analyzing non-numerical data, such as audio, images, videos, and text.

The practical exercises and projects were particularly beneficial, providing hands-on experience in applying various data analysis techniques. 
Overall, the Data Analysis course has significantly enriched my analytical skills and equipped me with valuable tools for tackling real-world data challenges. I am grateful for the enriching experience and the knowledge gained during the duration of this course.

Everything he taught was to the point, understandable, and woonderful to learn. Just a little bit more consideration for students - as in considering students as students rather than just candidates would help. I mean the personal attention, feedback and individualised experience would have made us excel more than what we have now. Thank you for everything you did and we are grateful to you forever."

I'm the kind of person that makes decisions based on analysis so finding out that there's an entire profession/subject for that definitely made the entire semester a breeze! i loved attending sir's classes and his teaching was beyond amazing too. i understood all the topics and his humor made the class much more fun and light hearted. Thank you so much for the experience sir! i had an absolute blast working with my teammates for the final project.
