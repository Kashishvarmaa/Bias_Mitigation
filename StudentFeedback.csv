In CO 1, I developed a solid data mindset and honed my ability to leverage GenAI and other resources for efficient initiation into data analysis, enhancing overall productivity. CO 2 and CO 3 equipped me with the skills to apply measures of central tendencies, variability, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis, and frequency table analysis, enabling me to identify patterns and trends within datasets. CO 4 expanded my knowledge to include data visualization techniques such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps, empowering me to detect outliers and explore correlations effectively. CO 5 emphasized the importance of data preprocessing, including handling missing values, duplicate values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to enhance data quality. The course delved into the art of effective data storytelling (CO 6), ensuring that I can communicate insights and recommendations for data-driven decision-making. CO 7 provided practical experience in data interpretation using visualizations created by India in Pixels. Moreover, the course broadened my perspective in CO 8 by highlighting the application of machine learning in analyzing non-numerical data, such as audio, images, videos, and text. Finally, in CO 9, I successfully applied the knowledge gained from CO 1 through CO 8 to tackle a new dataset in the form of a comprehensive project, solidifying my practical skills and understanding of the subject matter.",

The incorporation of GenAI and other resources was instrumental in quickly getting started with data analysis. What stood out was the practical application of knowledge in CO9, where we had the opportunity to tackle a new dataset and apply the comprehensive skill set acquired throughout the course.
